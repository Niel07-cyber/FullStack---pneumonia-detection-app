# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection Full Stack App (FastAPI + Next.js)

This project is a complete full-stack application for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning.

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **AI Model**: TensorFlow CNN (trained manually)
- **Deployment**: Local (localhost)

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FullStack---pneumonia-detection-app.git
cd FullStack---pneumonia-detection-app
2. Generate the Model (pneumonia_detector.h5)
⚠️ The trained model file pneumonia_detector.h5 was not uploaded because of GitHub's 100MB file size limit.

You must create it yourself:

Open the Jupyter Notebook located at:

bash
Copy
Edit
demo-backend/radiograph_ai.ipynb
Run the notebook cells.

After training, it will automatically create a file:

bash
Copy
Edit
demo-backend/pneumonia_detector.h5
✅ Now you are ready to run the backend.

3. Setup and Run Backend (FastAPI)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd demo-backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn tensorflow pillow
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
The backend will be live at http://localhost:8000

Test API using Swagger UI at http://localhost:8000/docs

4. Setup and Run Frontend (Next.js)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../demo-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
The frontend will be live at http://localhost:3000

📸 Features
Upload Chest X-ray images (.jpg/.jpeg/.png)

Get prediction: Pneumonia or Normal

See model confidence score for each prediction

Clean and responsive user interface

🧠 Tech Stack
Layer	Technologies
Backend	FastAPI, TensorFlow, Pillow
Frontend	Next.js 15 (React 18)
Machine Learning	Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Language	Python, JavaScript
⚡ Additional Notes
Make sure the backend server is running before using the frontend.

The frontend expects the backend API to be available at http://localhost:8000.

Always upload grayscale chest X-ray images for best results.

You can retrain the model anytime by running the provided Jupyter notebook.

# 🛠 **Small Reminder**

✅ Make sure you really add the `radiograph_ai.ipynb` notebook into `demo-backend/` before pushing again.

✅ Then update your GitHub repo to match this README!

✅ You’re done! 🎯

💬  
**Would you like me to also show you how to add a nice GitHub banner / badges (like "Made with FastAPI" or "TensorFlow") on top of your README?** 🎯

(They make your repo look even cooler 🚀)  
Let’s go if you want! 🚀✨  
Otherwise, CONGRATS!!! 🎉 You just completed a full-stack AI project!!
